At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Your answer...

# Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Difference 1: 

Bookstore ERD: In the bookstore ERD, customer details such as name, contact information, and address were all in a single table (or separated to a lesser degree). This results in some level of data redundancy.

Difference 2: 
AdventureWorks Schema: The Address table in the AdventureWorks schema links to other tables (Customer) through a relationship, and the schema appears to manage addresses by associating them with a specific order or entity, possibly allowing multiple addresses per customer.
Bookstore ERD: The proposed architecture for handling customer addresses included two options: one overwriting the previous address (Type 1) and another retaining address history (Type 2).
Potential Change: Inspired by the AdventureWorks schema, we could add an OrderAddress table that links Address to specific orders, making it possible to track which address was used for each specific order. This change can help if the bookstore wants to maintain records of past addresses in relation to sales.

Summary of Changes to Consider
Address Tracking: Implement an OrderAddress table to link addresses to individual orders, thereby retaining more specific history related to sales.
These changes would align the bookstoreâ€™s schema more closely with best practices and would be beneficial for scalability and detailed record-keeping, as exemplified by the AdventureWorks model.
